<h3><a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We want to implement large scale graph mining on GPUs and compare the runtime to the versions available for CPU.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p> This project is inspired from PEGASUS, which runs graph mining algorithms on the top of Hadoop.
The core idea of PEGASUS is converting graph mining problems to a matrix-vector multiplication and
using sql operations to achieve the computation. Therefore the primitive operation is GIM-V
(Generalized Iterated Matrix-Vector multiplication). Then it is implemented in Hadoop with some optimizations.
(See: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ukang/papers/PegasusKAIS.pdf">this paper</a> for details)</p>

<p>Previously, we implemented a sequential version of GIM-V in SQL. We plan to use this as a baseline to
measure the improvement of our code.
</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-challege" class="anchor" href="#the-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenge</h3>

<p>The challenge of this project is scaling up GPU to work on a large dataset. Local memory is
 limited, so we need to do many disk reads to compute over the entire graph. We need to
 efficiently hide the latency of these reads, and also improve the compute time such that, even
 with the additional latency, we still see a speed-up.</p>

<p>Another challenge would be scaling up to use multiple GPUs. Communication between 
GPUs will be difficult to implement, and also add further latency. A key point of our project will 
be analyzing these trade offs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>PEGASUS is an open source graph mining program, so we can directly download it from <a 
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pegasus/">their website</a>.</p>

<p>cuBLAS is provided by Nvidia to support the basic linear  algebra computing. And these 
operations should have been well optimized. But we don’t know whether we can still use them 
when we want to implement a scalable version, so we will try both this library and functions 
developed by ourselves.</p>

<h3>
<a id="goals-and-deliverables" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

<h4>PLAN TO ACHIEVE</h4>
<ul>
<li>A GPU version of one or more graph mining algorithms. Specifically, we plan to implement PageRank and Connected Components.</li>
<li>An analysis of PEGASUS, a sequential SQL version, and the GPU version on GB and TB sized graphs.</li>
<li>A GPU version which effectively uses multiple GPUs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>HOPE TO ACHIEVE</h4>
<ul>
<li>A hybrid version of CPU and GPU which can beat the performance of GPU alone.</li>
<li>Find an effective method to store sparse matrix on GPU (see <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p231-yang.pdf">http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p231-yang.pdf</a> )</li>
</ul>

<h4>DEMO</h4>
<p>At our demo, we plan to present several graphs comparing the runtime of our 3 algorithms 
on multiple input graphs for multiple graph mining algorithms. This should clearly show when 
each algorithm is superior to the others.</p>

<p>We probably won’t show a demo of our programs actually running, because it wouldn’t look 
very interesting, and it might take a while to run.</p>

<h4>WHAT WE HOPE TO LEARN</h4>
<p>We want to discover if the improved compute time of GPUs is worth the possible overhead 
of moving large quantities of data, such as those found in modern day graphs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h3>

<p>We plan to use the Latedays cluster to run our code, which will use Tesla K40 GPUs. The 
K40 are advanced GPUs used for scientific computing. Also, Latedays has a large memory and 
many multi-core CPUs making it ideal for parallelizing on the CPU as well. For consistency, we 
will also run the sequential SQL version on Latedays. In contrast, PEGASUS uses Hadoop cloud 
computing to run, so we can just run this with AWS.</p>
